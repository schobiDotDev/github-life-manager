## Action Steps
1. **Week 1: Foundation Setup**
   - Determine optimal bedtime for 6 AM wake-up (likely 10-10:30 PM)
   - Choose 3-4 simple breakfast options to rotate
   - Select 2-3 exercise routines (15-20 minutes each)

2. **Week 2: Implementation**
   - Start with basic routine: wake up, exercise, breakfast, plan
   - Track completion rate and energy levels
   - Adjust timing based on what works

3. **Week 3: Optimization**
   - Fine-tune routine based on week 2 learnings
   - Add any missing elements
   - Establish backup plans for difficult mornings

## Sample Routine Structure
- **6:00-6:05 AM:** Wake up, drink water, light stretching
- **6:05-6:25 AM:** Exercise (workout, yoga, or walk)
- **6:25-6:35 AM:** Shower and get dressed
- **6:35-6:55 AM:** Prepare and eat breakfast
- **6:55-7:05 AM:** Plan the day (review calendar, set priorities)
- **7:05-7:30 AM:** Final preparations, gather items, leave buffer time

## Notes
Consider starting with a simplified version (60 minutes) and gradually expanding to the full 90-minute routine. Track mood and energy levels to measure the routine's effectiveness. Plan for weekend variations that might be more flexible while maintaining the core habits.
