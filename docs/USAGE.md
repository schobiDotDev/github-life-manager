# Usage Guide

This guide covers how to use the GitHub Life Manager effectively.

## Creating Content

### Using Issue Templates

1. **Navigate to Issues** in your repository
2. **Click "New Issue"**
3. **Select appropriate template**:
   - üìã New Task - for actionable items
   - üöÄ New Project - for larger initiatives
   - üìù New Note - for information capture
   - üéØ New Goal - for objectives and targets

4. **Fill out the template** with your information
5. **Ensure `needs-ai` label is applied**
6. **Submit the issue**

### Quick Capture

For rapid content input, use the Quick Capture link:
- Creates a simple issue with just a title and body
- Perfect for capturing thoughts on the go
- Claude will categorize and enhance the content

## Enhancement Process

### What Happens When You Submit

1. **Issue Creation**: Your issue is created with the `needs-ai` label
2. **Trigger**: GitHub Action detects the label and starts Claude Code
3. **Analysis**: Claude analyzes your content and determines the type
4. **Enhancement**: Content is improved and structured using templates
5. **File Creation**: A properly formatted file is created in the appropriate directory
6. **Pull Request**: Claude opens a PR with the enhanced content
7. **Issue Closure**: Original issue is closed with a reference to the new content

### Review and Merge

- **Review the PR** to ensure the enhancement meets your needs
- **Make adjustments** if necessary by editing the files directly
- **Merge the PR** to add the content to your life management system

## Content Organization

### Directory Structure

Your content is automatically organized into:

```
content/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/          # Daily and project tasks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/       # Large initiatives and projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes/          # Meeting notes, research, ideas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goals/          # Personal and professional goals
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/        # Completed or outdated content
```

### File Naming

Files follow consistent naming conventions:
- **Tasks**: `2024-01-15-update-website.md`
- **Projects**: `website-redesign.md`
- **Notes**: `2024-01-15-team-meeting.md`
- **Goals**: `learn-python.md`

### Tagging System

Content is tagged for easy organization:
- **Priority**: `high-priority`, `medium-priority`, `low-priority`
- **Category**: `work`, `personal`, `health`, `education`
- **Status**: `active`, `completed`, `on-hold`
- **Context**: `home`, `office`, `travel`

## Best Practices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Claude doesn't process my issue**:
